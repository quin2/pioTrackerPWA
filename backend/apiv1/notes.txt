use rabbitMQ with celery:
	good, but requires process calls to different machines
	still have problem of how to run something every x seconds
	and its still only ONE task

Option B:
	make bash script that runs then sleeps every 10s
	write to common output file that is scrubbed and read by API

option C:
	Like B, but with database that's production ready running in background! 

use #!/bin/env bash for linux...
change python3 to python

NOW TIME TO DEPLOY!!!!

Sidestep complex stuff....

run nginx, serve json file from var/www
run script in background!!!

chromedriver runs WAY faster than firefox ever did...
